## macOS
 - Assumes [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is installed
 - Design goals:
   - We do **not need** any 3rd party terminal emulator - just enable _"Use Option as Meta key"_ in _Terminal.app_. 🖥️
   - Have a **decent** prompt **WITHOUT** _"oh-my-zsh"_ or other shell-plugin-manager-framework bloat fest 🙈
   - Print our **local IP address** & local router IP address when a new terminal opens 🛜
   - **Colorize** the most common utilities' output using native tools already present in macOS 🏳️‍🌈
